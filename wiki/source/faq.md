Disk Quotas Now Enforced
------------------------

To help keep tilde.club running smoothly, we've introduced disk quotas. This helps make sure everyone gets their fair share of space and keeps the system in good shape.

**Here's what you need to know:**

-   **Soft Limit:** 1 GB – You'll get a heads-up if you go over this, but you can still use more space up to the hard limit.
-   **Hard Limit:** 3 GB – This is the max. If you hit this limit, you'll need to clear some space before adding more files.
-   **Grace Period:** 1 week – If you exceed the soft limit, you have 7 days to get back under it before the hard limit kicks in.

You can check your usage and see how much space you have left by running the `resources-used` script in your home directory.

If you have any questions or run into any issues, just reach out. We're all in this together!

My function keys don't work in byobu! (using Windows PuTTY)
------------------------------------------------------------------

**TL;DR**

Change your Terminal->Keyboard->"The Function keys and keypad" setting to "XTerm R6".

**Details**

I am using PuTTY 0.73 Windows 11, and could not get byobu hotkeys to work. Instead of creating or changing windows with F2, F3, and F4, the byobu command line would display a ~ every time I hit a a function key. The solution was to change my PuTTY settings for "XTerm R6" emulation. Now the Function keys work great, including F8! Note there are other articles out there that suggest using "VT100+" instead of "XTerm R6". Althought VT100+ helped out F2, F3, and F4, it *did not help F8* and some of the higher keys--that is where "XTerm R6" solved the rest.
